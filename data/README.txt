All the subhalos accreted onto the Milky Way (M_{200}=1e12 Msun at
z=0) with pre-infall mass greater than M_{200} = 1e5 Msun are listed.

Explanation of columns:
1: Pre-infall mass at accretion, m200 [Msun]
2: Accretion redshift, z_a
3: Scale radius at accretion, r_{s,a} [kpc]
4: Characteristic density at accretion, \rho_{s,a} [Msun/pc^3]
5: Mass at z=0 after tidal stripping, m0 [Msun]
6: Scale radius at z=0, r_{s,0} [kpc]
7: Characteristic density at z=0, \rho_{s,0} [Msun/pc^3]
8: Truncation radius in units of scale radius, c_{t,0}=r_{t,0}/r_{s,0}
9: Sub-subhalo boost at accretion, B_{sh,a}
10: Sub-subhalo boost at z=0 after tidal stripping, B_{sh,0}
11: Sub-subhalo mass fraction at accretion, f_{sh,a}
12: Sub-subhalo mass fraction at z=0 after tidal stripping, f_{sh,0}
13: Weight of each row (number of subhalos assinged to it)
